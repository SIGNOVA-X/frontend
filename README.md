## 🧩 Problem Statement

Despite advancements in technology, millions of deaf and mute individuals around the world still face significant barriers in everyday communication. From casual conversations and accessing emergency help to participating in online meetings and forming social connections, the lack of inclusive communication tools leads to isolation, misunderstanding, and exclusion.

The communication gap faced by deaf and dumb individuals significantly impacts their mental health, often leading to feelings of isolation, frustration, and low self-worth. Due to the lack of accessible communication tools and inclusive environments, around 72% of deaf and dumb individuals tend to avoid social gatherings. This avoidance stems from the fear of being misunderstood, excluded, or unable to express themselves freely. Over time, this social withdrawal contributes to increased loneliness, anxiety, and even depression, as these individuals are unable to form meaningful connections or participate fully in society. The absence of inclusive communication solutions not only limits their opportunities but also affects their emotional and psychological well-being.

Traditional methods like text messaging or human interpreters are not always accessible, affordable, or real-time. This communication gap not only limits personal and professional opportunities but also impacts emotional well-being and mental health.

There is a pressing need for an intelligent, accessible, and real-time solution that empowers deaf and mute individuals to communicate effortlessly, connect meaningfully, and feel supported—just like anyone else.

**SIGNOVA-X** addresses this gap by leveraging AI, computer vision, and natural language processing to build a bridge between sign language and spoken language, enabling seamless two-way communication and emotional support in an inclusive digital environment.
