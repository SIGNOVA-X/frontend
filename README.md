## üß© Problem Statement

Despite advancements in technology, millions of deaf and mute individuals around the world still face significant barriers in everyday communication. From casual conversations and accessing emergency help to participating in online meetings and forming social connections, the lack of inclusive communication tools leads to isolation, misunderstanding, and exclusion.

Traditional methods like text messaging or human interpreters are not always accessible, affordable, or real-time. This communication gap not only limits personal and professional opportunities but also impacts emotional well-being and mental health.

There is a pressing need for an intelligent, accessible, and real-time solution that empowers deaf and mute individuals to communicate effortlessly, connect meaningfully, and feel supported‚Äîjust like anyone else.

**SIGNOVA** addresses this gap by leveraging AI, computer vision, and natural language processing to build a bridge between sign language and spoken language, enabling seamless two-way communication and emotional support in an inclusive digital environment.
